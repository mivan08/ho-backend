# Welcome to Gelu Horotan's Backend!

This repository serves as the backbone of my [personal portfolio](https://github.com/GeluHorotan/geluhorotan.com), providing an API for managing and delivering data in a seamless and organized manner. With a custom error middleware in place, errors are handled gracefully, ensuring a smooth user experience. Form validation guarantees the integrity of the data, while integration with MongoDB through Mongoose enables efficient and flexible data management. By leveraging API routes and controllers, I can easily manage and manipulate the data displayed on my website.
